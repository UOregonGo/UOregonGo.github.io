    <h2>Judge Rubric</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    
    <li style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <b>Poster Quality (score: 1-10):</b> Evaluates the visual appeal, clarity, and organization of the poster. High-scoring posters are well-designed with logical structure, readable fonts, appropriate use of visuals (graphs, images), and minimal distractions. Lower scores indicate clutter, hard-to-read text, or poor layout.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <b>Presentation Quality (score: 1-10):</b> Assesses the speaker's ability to communicate their research effectively. Criteria include clarity of speech, confidence, engagement with the audience, and time management. High scores reflect a compelling, well-rehearsed presentation.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <b>Research Novelty and Impact (score: 1-10):</b> Judges the originality and creativity of the research question, methodology, or application. In addition, the committee will measures the significance and potential impact of the research. This includes contributions to the field, real-world application, or potential to inspire future work. A top score indicates a highly innovative and impactful project that addresses an unexplored or emerging problem. 
    </li>

    <li style="margin-left: 80px;">
    <b>Minimum standard for award:</b> All posters must obtain a minimum score of 8 in each category to qualify for awards. This ensures that only high-quality work is recognized and rewarded. Posters that do not meet this threshold will not be considered for any awards, regardless of their overall score.
    </li>
